# Chatbot Sentiment and Stylistic Analysis Project

## Description
This project involves developing a chatbot capable of performing sentiment and stylistic analysis on user inputs. The chatbot integrates various machine learning models, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, and MLP, to analyze the sentiment and style of the conversation. The chatbot aims to understand the user's mood and provide meaningful insights based on their responses.

## Introduction
The chatbot is designed to interact with users, understand their sentiments, and provide stylistic analysis of their inputs. This project was developed for the CS 421 course and includes various functionalities to analyze text data and provide insightful feedback based on machine learning models.

## Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifies user input as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Stylistic Analysis**: Analyzes the style of the user's input and identifies psychological correlates.
- **Multiple Model Integration**: Utilizes different machine learning models for robust analysis.
- **Interactive Chat**: Engages users in a conversation, allowing them to redo analyses or terminate the session.

### Interaction Example
Here is a sample interaction with the chatbot:

```
Welcome to the CS 421 chatbot!  
What is your name?
Firoz Shaik
Thanks Firoz Shaik! What do you want to talk about today?
I'm really disappointed and frustrated with the recent turn of events and it's hard to find any positives in the situation.
Hmm it seems like you're feeling a bit down.
I'd also like to do a quick stylistic analysis. What's on your mind today?
Despite facing challenges, I am determined to achieve my goals and make a positive impact on the world. The journey may be tough but I believe in my abilities and the power of perseverance.
Thanks! Based on my stylistic analysis, I've identified the following psychological correlates in your response:
- Informal personal
- Use of concrete nouns: interest in objects/things
- Education: concern with precision
Which state would you like to enter next? (Type 'terminate' 'redo sentiment' or 'redo stylistic'): terminate
```

## Evaluation
### Pilot Evaluation
Conducted two different interactions with the chatbot, as described in the [Evaluation of Chatbot document](#). The chatbot successfully performed sentiment and stylistic analyses, providing meaningful insights based on user inputs.

### User Feedback
Two participants interacted with the chatbot, and their feedback was collected. The chatbot performed as expected, with participants successfully completing both sentiment and stylistic analyses. The interaction was smooth, and the chatbot's responses were relevant and insightful.

## Future Work
If given additional time, the following improvements could be made:
1. **Enhanced NLP Capabilities**: Incorporate advanced NLP libraries like spaCy or Transformers to improve language understanding.
2. **Expanded Training Dataset**: Use a larger and more diverse dataset to enhance the chatbot's ability to handle various topics.
3. **Dynamic Learning**: Implement a feedback loop to allow the chatbot to learn and adapt based on user interactions.
4. **User Interface Improvements**: Redesign the interface for a more intuitive and engaging user experience.
