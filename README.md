# Chatbot-Development-Project
Developed an advanced chatbot using Python and machine learning models for the sentiment and stylistic analysis of user inputs. Integrated sklearn's Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, and MLP Classifier models for text classification. Leveraged NLP techniques including TF-IDF vectorization and Word2Vec embeddings to enhance model accuracy in interpreting user sentiment and stylistic attributes from text. Implemented feature extraction functions to analyze linguistic patterns and psycholinguistic correlates, applying nltk for tokenization and POS tagging. Designed a multi-state dialogue system for interactive user engagement, enabling dynamic transitions between conversation states based on user responses. Utilized pickle for model serialization and efficient data handling, ensuring robust performance and scalability of the chatbot system.
